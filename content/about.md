## Experience

### Jaume I University, Spain

- **External lecturer**, 2020 - present

    I teach the second module of the SIQ025 and SIQ525 subjects included in the master's degree in Computational Mathematics.

- **Research technician**, 2018 - present

    I am part of the DPI2017-87333-R project of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain. I am in charge of conducting tests and experiments and analyzing the results. I have also started researching in the field of archetypal analysis, publishing several articles and posters.

### Francesc Alted, Spain

- **Software analyst and designer**, 2018 - present

    We are currently focusing on combining high performance algorithms and chunked data compression. I lead the Caterva project, an open source library that allows to store large multidimensional, chunked, compressed datasets. I am also part of the well known Blosc project, a high performance compressor specifically designed for binary data. Furthermore, I am one of the main developers of a new computational engine optimized for big-data applications called Iron Array.
